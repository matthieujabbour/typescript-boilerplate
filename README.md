# project-boilerplate

Monorepo for different projects development use-cases. Contains a complete, ready-to-use structure and codebase for the following types of projects, based on [typescript-dev-kit](https://github.com/openizr/typescript-dev-kit):

- [NPM package or classic library](https://github.com/openizr/project-boilerplate/tree/npm-package)
- [Back-end/front-end with Fastify and VueJS](https://github.com/openizr/project-boilerplate/tree/fastify-vue)
- [Back-end/front-end with Fastify and React](https://github.com/openizr/project-boilerplate/tree/fastify-react)

You can directly use one of those boilerplates by retrieving the proper branch:

```bash
git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>
```
